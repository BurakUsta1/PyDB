# PyDB v0.1

PyDB is a simple database management system built using the SQLite module. 
This project is designed to run on Android devices and currently only supports Turkish language. Below you can find the updates that will come in the next version. I do not currently have enough time to develop and develop this project further. But I welcome community input to help improve PyDB. Your support and improvements are highly appreciated. I expect you to help me on this matter.

#### Planned Features

1. **Error Management Improvements:**
 - Addition of Try Catch blog for database connection and deletions.
 - Providing more detailed error messages to users.

2. **Code Optimization:**
 - Reducing code duplication, especially around database connection logic.
 - Optimizing performance for faster database operations.

3. **Cross-Platform Support:**
 - Implementation of support for searching ".db" files on Android as well as Windows and Linux operating systems.
 - Ability to use the file search function on different platforms without any problems.

4. **English Language Support:**
 - Implementation of English language support to ensure that the application reaches a wider audience.

5. **SQL Code Execution:**
 - Adding a feature that allows users to directly enter SQL commands to edit tables in databases.
